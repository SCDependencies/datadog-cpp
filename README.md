# datadog-cpp
Datadog C++ Statsd Client Library

Tested on Linux and OSX.

## Buiild
The build requires a C++11 compiler (tested on gcc and clang) and `cmake (>=3.1.0)`.
```
cmake .
make
```
That should drop the shared library in `./lib` and be ready to go.

## TODO
- write unit tests
- ~~static build~~
